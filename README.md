Read the arguments, bind to the specified port, and find your document root (you might find the chdir() system call helpful). Accept a connection, and hand it off to a new thread for concurrent processing. Receive and parse a request from the client. Look for the path that was requested, starting from your document root (the second argument to your program). One of four things should happen: If the path exists and it’s a file, formulate a response (with the Content-Type header set) and send it back to the client. If the path exists and it’s a directory that contains an index.html file, respond with that file. If the path exists and it’s a directory that does NOT contain an index.html file, respond with a directory listing. If the path does not exist, respond with a 404 code with a basic error page. Close the connection, and continue serving other clients. Turn-in instructions and Grading
